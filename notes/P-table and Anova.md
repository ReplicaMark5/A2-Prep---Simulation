- So, when your textbook mentions a “p-table” after discussing confidence intervals and comparisons, it means:
- The p-table is **based on the ANOVA results**, showing detailed pairwise significance.

In short:
- ANOVA = global test (“is there any difference?”)
- P-table = pairwise breakdown (“which pairs differ?”)

Thus the p-table is **derived from ANOVA**, not identical to it.

> *"We use the table with p-values from the ANOVA to determine that. The p-values associated with Figure 5.16 are shown in Table 5.2, for α = 5% . The direction of the ANOVA is symmetrical, i.e. comparing Exp4 and Exp5 is the same as comparing Exp5 and Exp4. One can see that Exp1 and Exp2 have a common mean, as the p-value=0.359. Exp1 and Exp3 differ significantly, because the p-value<5%. This is also true for Exp(1,4), Exp(1,5), Exp(2,3), Exp(2,4), Exp(2,5), Exp(3,4) and Exp(3,5). But Exp4 and Exp5 do not differ significantly because p = 0.438 > α. We choose Exp4 as the best, since it has the highest throughput; although Exp5 has a numerically higher throughput, it is similar to Exp4 but more expensive. Remember the experiments were arranged to become progressively more expensive. We would thus not select Exp5, as it yields the same output but is more expensive."*
