## üß¨ Genetic Algorithm (GA) ‚Äî A2 Exam Notes

### 1. Core Concept

- GA is a **meta-heuristic optimisation method** inspired by natural selection.
    
- Used to **search large decision spaces** efficiently when analytical optimisation is impractical.
    
- Produces _good_, not guaranteed optimal, solutions within reasonable time.

### 2. Key Terms to Know

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Population**|Set of possible solutions in one generation. Controls how widely the search explores the solution space.|
|**Generation**|Each iteration of evolution. Controls how long the algorithm ‚Äúlearns‚Äù ‚Äî exploitation.|
|**Chromosome / Individual**|One candidate solution (a vector of decision variables).|
|**Fitness Function**|Objective value(s) evaluated for each individual ‚Äî corresponds to simulation outputs (Z·µ¢).|
|**Crossover**|Combines parts of two parent solutions to create offspring ‚Äî main exploration mechanism.|
|**Mutation**|Randomly alters some solution elements ‚Äî prevents premature convergence and adds diversity.|
|**Selection**|Chooses which individuals become parents based on fitness. Drives exploitation.|

### 3. Exploration vs. Exploitation (Exam Focus)

> **Explore** = how wide you look.  
> **Exploit** = how well you use information gathered.

|Concept|Controlled By|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Exploration**|**Population size**|Larger population ‚Üí more diverse search, broader coverage of decision space.|
|**Exploitation**|**Number of generations**|More generations ‚Üí deeper learning, but higher computational cost.|
|**Trade-off**|Must balance search diversity vs. computation time.||

Refer to [[Exploration vs Exploitation]] for a more in depth guide

### 4. Lecturer‚Äôs Emphasis

- ‚ÄúYou must know **crossover**, **mutation**, **population size**, **number of generations**.‚Äù
    
- Understand their roles in **exploration and exploitation** ‚Äî _not memorisation of code or equations_.
    
- ‚ÄúKnow **how** and **why**, not syntax.‚Äù
    
- GA is part of **simulation-optimisation (SO)** ‚Äî applied to find near-optimal system settings when simulation output is stochastic.

### 5. In the Exam

Expect conceptual or short applied questions like:

- _‚ÄúExplain the difference between exploration and exploitation in a GA.‚Äù_
    
- _‚ÄúWhich parameters affect each?‚Äù_
    
- _‚ÄúWhat does crossover achieve?‚Äù_
    
- _‚ÄúHow does population size affect computational cost and diversity?‚Äù_

### 6. Practical Insight

- Increasing population size increases exploration but slows runtime.
    
- Increasing generations increases convergence precision but raises computation cost.
    
- Mutation keeps diversity high; without it, the algorithm may converge prematurely.
    
- Always link GA terms to **decision variables (x·µ¢)** and **response outputs (Z·µ¢)** from your simulation.

### 7. Related Topics (linked in Section 6 of eBook)

- **Simulation-optimisation (SO)**: GA as a search engine around a simulation model.
    
- **Multi-objective optimisation (MOO)**: GAs can generate Pareto fronts (e.g., NSGA-II).
    
- **MOSO** (multi-objective simulation-optimisation): adds replication (n*) for stochastic evaluation.

Would you like me to make a **1-page printable cheat-sheet** version (with diagrams showing exploration vs. exploitation and GA flow)? It would summarise everything visually for quick revision.
