> [!summary] Hypothesis Test Decision Logic (t-test)
> **Null Hypothesis:**  
> $$H_0:\ \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$$
>
> | Condition | Decision | Interpretation |
> |------------|-----------|----------------|
> | **p < 0.05** | **Reject** $H_0$ | The difference in means is **statistically significant** — the two scenario results **do differ**. |
> | **p ≥ 0.05** | **Fail to reject** $H_0$ | The difference in means is **not statistically significant** — the two scenarios’ results are **not different**. |
>
> ✅ **Remember:**  
> - Reject $H_0$ → evidence that results **differ**.  
> - Fail to reject $H_0$ → results **likely differ only by chance**.

>   3. What does population size control?
>     - Exploration - how widely you search the solution space
>     - Larger population = more diverse search
>   4. What does number of generations control?
>     - Exploitation - how deeply you refine solutions
>     - More generations = more learning, but higher computational cost

>[!abstract] LEARN
>   1. Understanding Figure 6.1 in your notes (SO feedback loop) ⭐
>   2. Memorizing exploration vs exploitation (lecturer's emphasis) ⭐
>   3. Understanding Figure 6.11 (very important per survival kit) ⭐
>   4. Knowing MOSO concepts (approximate Pareto front)
>   5. Practicing Pareto ranking (you must be able to do this)
